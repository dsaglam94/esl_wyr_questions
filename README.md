  ## How it's made:
  <strong>Tech used:</strong> NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB, Mongoose, JavaScript, EJS JavaScript Template, CSS
  
  Handling backend and frontend with JavaScript is unbelievable. I built this CRUD API using MongoDB for the database to hold the data and NodeJs / ExpressJs to handle the server side. In order to dynamicaly render out the data, I used a very popular JavaScript Template called EJS.
  
  ## Lessons Learned:
  
  Creating, updating or reading can be done in server-side but deleting should be done in client-side. So I had to find the right way to implement this to my project. Hopefully, I've come accross with a good article about this situation. 
    
  Overall, this was a tremendous learning experience.
